## Overview

## Goal

## Objectives
1. Perform web scraping to extract data (Business and News articles) from News API. It should contain at least 1000 words in total and at least two categories with at least 100 examples per category.
2. Split the dataset into training (at least 160 examples) and test (at least 40 examples) sets.
3. Fine-tune a pretrained language model (Albert-base-v2) capable of generating text on this dataset (the one I created in part 1). Report the test accuracy. Discuss what could be done to improve accuracy.
4. Try a couple of different language models (GPT-J and GPT-Sw3) to gain a better understanding.
